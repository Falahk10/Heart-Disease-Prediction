# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Preventing heart diseases is crucial for improving overall health. Machine Learning plays a vital role in predicting heart disease with remarkable accuracy, aiding research and prevention efforts. This project analyzed a heart disease dataset, processed the data, and applied various machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease.

Key Details:
Objective: Predict heart disease presence (binary classification) using patient parameters.
Algorithms Used:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (Linear)
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Artificial Neural Network (1 hidden layer)
Tools:
Implemented in Python using Scikit-learn and Keras.
Achieved 95% accuracy with the Random Forest algorithm.
This project served as the codebase for my Kaggle kernel, "Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras."
